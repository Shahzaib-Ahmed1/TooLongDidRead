![alt text](./cold,%20smooth%20&%20tasty..png)

This project is intended to showcase a potential tool that can be used by amateur stargazers to enter their location and then get the upcoming evening's stargazing weather conditions, pulled from a weather API, as well as the constellations, planets, and satellities that can be seen at night, pulled from a dataset of such astronomical objects. The intended tool would also have a window to a chatbot that is prompt engineered to speak in stephen hawking's style, intended to be used for teaching fellow astronomers.

As such, the current project is a static website with a search bar, with two windows below it that could show the local weather and constellations in view.
Under it, there is an earth model that would home-in on the user's location in the working prototype.
